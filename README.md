# Keylogger-ChildGuard
The project aims to develop an ethical and discreet Parental Control Keylogger, enabling parents to monitor their children's online activities responsibly for their safety. The keylogger will operate covertly, capturing keystrokes, tracking visited websites, and monitoring application usage without the child's knowledge.
Before running the code, you need to ensure that you have installed the required Python packages by using the following commands in the command prompt:
Install the required packages:

pip install pynput
pip install pycryptodome
Make sure you have Python installed on your system and the pip package manager is available in the command prompt.

After installing the required packages, you can run the code by creating a Python script file (e.g., childguard_keylogger.py) and copying the code into it. Then, simply execute the Python script using the following command:

python childguard_keylogger.py
This will start the ChildGuard Keylogger application, and a GUI window will appear with buttons for various functionalities like starting the keylogger, saving encrypted logs, displaying educational resources, and showing comprehensive reports and customizable settings. From there, you can interact with the application and use the different features provided by the ChildGuard Keylogger.
Or
You can run the code directly in an IDE  without creating a separate Python script file. When using an IDE, you can simply open a new Python file, copy the code into it, and then run the code within the IDE itself.
