# Keylogger-ChildGuard
This code is written in Python 3.x and this will help the parents in tracking their children's device usage or rather what they are searching
The project aims to develop an ethical and discreet Parental Control Keylogger, enabling parents to monitor their children's online activities responsibly for their safety. The keylogger will operate covertly, capturing keystrokes, tracking visited websites, and monitoring application usage without the child's knowledge.![image](https://github.com/Samprikta-Mondal/Keylogger-ChildGuard/assets/102063409/8e5b2908-e0b9-4994-9de2-adac5b569227)
